# OpenCV-Motion-Detector-With-Streamlit
A simple motion detector made simply with the help of streamlit and OpenCV python with the use of WebCam to detect the motion of objects with bounding boxes and sounding an alert based on the motion of the object captured by the webcam .
Further it can also be modified to detect the motion from any video by simply passing the file name or path to capture function instead of 0 for Webcam
